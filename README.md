## I code on Windows

This project will be called SOON **medusa-marketplace-nextjs**

### In developement

The Medusa server is installed on a VirtualBox Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop, it's why I access the endpoint with the url http://192.168.0.45:9000

The port 3000 is the default port for Next

So you have the change the medusa.config.js file with this port instead of 8000

### In production

TODO

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone <nextjs-marketplace-medusa>
cd nextjs-marketplace-medusa
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
